Just bought `The Terraform Book` to review what I might be missing. Great read so far.

## Ideas

### Terraform Lookup Module:

* When looking into the different regions `us-east-1` vs `us-west-1` there are diff AZ's in each region.

Here is a region_list.
```
variable "region_list" {
  description = "AWS availability zones."
  default = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
}
```

Better example of a lookup
```
variable "region_list" {
  description = "The AMIs to use."
  type = "map"
  default = {
    us-east-1 = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c", "us-east-1d", "us-east-1e", "us-east-1f"]
    us-west-1 = ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1b"]
  }
}
```


* It would be great to have a `lookup` module to contain:
  * AZ's
  * Regions
  * not sure what else.


### Module Standards

* How do we check the syntax of each module?
* How can we run unit tests?
