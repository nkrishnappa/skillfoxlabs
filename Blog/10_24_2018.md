Just bought `The Terraform Book` to review what I might be missing. Great read so far.

## Ideas

1. Terraform Lookup Module:
  * When looking into the different regions `us-east-1` vs `us-west-1` there are diff AZ's in each region.

Here is a region_list.
```
variable "region_list" {
  description = "AWS availability zones."
  default = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
}
```

  * It would be great to have a `lookup` module to contain:
    * AZ's
    * Regions
    * not sure what else.d
